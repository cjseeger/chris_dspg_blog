No class on Monday! It is Memorial Day! In the week prior I learned about making a Blog in R. I should have some code here, but lake photos are more fun.

```{r}
a <- "Hello World!"
b <- "Now I have some code added."
message <- paste(a, b, sep=" ", collapse=NULL)
message
```

Tried out a fly on an old fly rod and was successful!

Watched 11 little Mallard ducklings while ate the lake ove rhte holiday weekend.
