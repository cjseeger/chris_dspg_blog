# Chris's DSPG Blog for 2023 - This is week 3.

No class on Monday! It is Memorial Day! In the week prior I learned about making a Blog in R. I should have some code here, but lake photos are more fun.

```{r}
j = "Hello World"
j
```

Tried out a fly on an old fly rod and was successful!

Watched 11 little Mallard ducklings while ate the lake ove rhte holiday weekend.
