This is Chris's first post in a Quarto blog. I needed to go back and created something for week one of DSPG. I was curious how to establish categories and set the default images, so this blog focuses on a few flowers in my yard.

The columbine was planted two years ago, but did not grow well last year. This year it looks very nice.
