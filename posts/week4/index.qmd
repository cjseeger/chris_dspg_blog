Brought a maple log home from the lake. Slabbed it out when I got home and have it on the drying rack. Hopefully it will not warp and I can use it for guitar necks.

```{r}
beaver <- "A maple tree cut down by a beaver"
chainsaw <- "and then cut into logs "
bandsaw <- "makes great source for woodworking projects!"

woodworking = paste(beaver, chainsaw, bandsaw)
woodworking

```
